# La La Dance
A fun (and not serious) personality test to find your social dance style.
## Built with 
- HTML
- CSS & SCSS
- Javascript, ReactJS, React Bootstrap
## What's next to do?
- fix sticky hover effects on mobile devices!
- use a library (like Radium) for inline styles so that hovered buttons display the text in white with colored shadows. cf. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28365233/inline-css-styles-in-react-how-to-implement-ahover
- handle focus and active style for links and buttons
- add dance video to results for curious people
- add share buttons
